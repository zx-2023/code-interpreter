## to be updated

interface.py is the main function of the interpreter, it generates responses to the query input by the end user.
Currently, it only supports very basic data analysis and plotting functions.

To start with the program, user "pip install requirements.txt -r" first, then type in "streamlit run interface.py" from the command prompt

To properly use the demo, make you have created a file named <secrets.toml> 
which has "OPEN_API_KEY=***" in it, otherwise you'll have to create an environment variable
